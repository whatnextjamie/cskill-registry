# cskill-registry

The cskill-registry is the public, community-maintained registry that powers package discovery for the [cskill](https://github.com/whatnextjamie/cskill) ecosystem. It serves as the index of all published Claude Code skill packages, enabling the `cskill search` command to surface available skills.

This repository hosts the canonical index.json file — the single source of truth for all registered packages. Contributors can submit pull requests to add or update entries, and each approved change automatically rebuilds and commits the registry index.

### Example workflow:
1. Fork this repo
2. Add your package to index.json
3. Submit a pull request
4. Once merged, your skill becomes discoverable via cskill search

## How to Add Your Package

**Simple:** Just submit a PR adding your repository to `repositories.json`

### Step 1: Publish Your Skill Package

```bash
cd your-skill-package
cskill init
cskill publish
git push
```

Ensure your repository includes:
- `skill-package.json` with package metadata
- One or more skill directories with `SKILL.md` files
- Each `SKILL.md` must have frontmatter with `name` and `description`

### Step 2: Add to Registry

Fork this repository and add your repo to `repositories.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-skills.git",
      "branch": "main"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Submit Pull Request

The registry maintainer will:
1. Review your skill package
2. Run `npm run build` to generate `index.json`
3. Merge if valid

**That's it!** The registry automatically extracts:
- Package name, version, description
- Author and keywords
- Skill names from your skill-package.json
- All sourced from SKILL.md frontmatter

## Single Source of Truth

The registry maintains **zero duplication**:

```
SKILL.md frontmatter → skill-package.json → index.json (generated)
```

1. **SKILL.md frontmatter** - Source of truth for each skill
2. **skill-package.json** - Generated by `cskill init` from frontmatter
3. **index.json** - Generated by `npm run build` from skill-package.json

## For Registry Maintainers

### Building the Index

```bash
npm run build
```

This fetches each repository's `skill-package.json` and generates `index.json`.

### Adding a New Package

1. Verify the repository has valid `skill-package.json`
2. Add repository to `repositories.json`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Commit both `repositories.json` and generated `index.json`

## Guidelines

- Package names must be lowercase with hyphens only (e.g., `my-awesome-skills`)
- Repository must be public and accessible
- Test your package with `cskill install` before submitting
- Ensure all SKILL.md files have proper frontmatter

## SKILL.md Frontmatter Requirement

Every `SKILL.md` file must include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does
---

# Skill Content...
```

This ensures consistency across:
- The skill file itself (Claude reads this)
- The package metadata
- The registry index

## Package Requirements

Your skill package repository must include:
- `skill-package.json` - Package metadata (generated by `cskill init`)
- One or more skill directories with `SKILL.md` files
- Each SKILL.md with valid frontmatter
- Clear documentation in a README
